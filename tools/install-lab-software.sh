# install-lab-software.sh
#
# The one admin-run install for a lab Mac. Everything both units need:
# the .app bundles, the command-line tools, the Ollama model, and the uv
# caches — from a USB drive, with no network. One command per machine.
# See LAB-SETUP.md and DECISIONS #23, #30, #40, #41, #43, #44 (nhsengineering).
#
# Was install-ollama.sh. One script, not several, for the reason #30 gave:
# a step worth doing belongs in the automation, not in a list of things to
# remember to do correctly twenty times.
#
# Nothing here is hardcoded to a particular app. Drop a new tool on the
# drive in the right folder and the next run installs it.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./install-lab-software.sh          install everything
#   ./install-lab-software.sh --check       validate the drive, change nothing
#
# Run --check on your own Mac before you carry the drive anywhere. It costs
# a second and it is the difference between finding a bad payload here and
# finding it on the twentieth machine.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What the drive holds, beside this script:
#
#   apps/*.app      .app bundles, copied as themselves. This is the simple
#                   path and it needs the drive to be **Mac OS Extended
#                   (Journaled)** or APFS.
#   apps/*.zip      the same bundles wrapped with `ditto -c -k --keepParent`,
#                   for a FAT32 or exFAT drive, which cannot store the
#                   symlinks, permissions and extended attributes a bundle is
#                   made of. A bundle copied straight to FAT arrives with a
#                   broken signature and macOS refuses it: "damaged or
#                   incomplete." Either form works; --check tells you if you
#                   have the wrong one for the filesystem you are on.
#   bin/*           plain single-file executables, e.g. uv. Copied to
#                   /usr/local/bin as-is.
#   clitools.txt    tools that live inside an app bundle and need a symlink.
#                   One per line:   name :: path/inside/Applications
#   models/         ONE Ollama model, staged with tools/stage-model.sh. Not a
#                   copy of ~/.ollama/models, which carries every model you
#                   have ever pulled — DECISIONS #43.
#   uv-cache/       optional. Seeds UV_CACHE_DIR so pygame never downloads.
#   uv-python/      optional. Seeds UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR, which UV_CACHE_DIR
#                   does not cover — separate variable, separate folder.
#   arduino15/      optional. Board packages for the one account that needs
#                   the Arduino IDE. Set ARDUINO_ACCOUNTS below.
#
# The last three may also be `.tar` instead of a folder, which is what a FAT
# drive needs: a uv-managed Python contains symlinks too.
#
# Anything optional that is missing is skipped with a note, not an error.
